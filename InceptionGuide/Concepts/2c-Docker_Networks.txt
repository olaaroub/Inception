What is a Docker Network ?
	A Docker Network is a virtual environment where member Containers
	can communicate with each other and other external systems (If the Network Allows it by Mapping the necessary Ports). 
	This helps in isolating and securing Containers while also having control over how they can interact with other systems both in and out of the Network

What are the different kinds of Docker Networks ?
	Docker has by default three running networks : Bridge, Host and None
		Bridge	: When a new container runs, it is automatically attributed to the Bridge Network (unless you specify another network manually).
					Containers on the same Bridge can communicate with each other, but not with other networks.
		Host	: Containers use the Host's network and IP.
		None	: The Container does not belong to ANY Network and is basically isolated.

What is Port Mapping ?
	Docker allows containers to interact and communicate with other networks and external systems via Port Mapping. It allows you to expose a Container's ports to the Host's ports.
	This is required by containers running Webservers and other similar network services.
