------------------------What is docker container--------------------------------------

"Container is a running instance of an image, isolated and enhanced with its own state, processes, network, and filesystem layer."

✅ How Does a Docker Container Work?
		To simplify:
			🔹 Docker Image = the recipe (instructions + ingredients)
			🔹 Docker Container = the actual cooked dish (running instance)

✅ This command: docker run nginx
		Takes the nginx image
		Creates a live instance = a container
		Starts the web server inside

✅ What Creates the Isolation in a Docker Container? (Going Deeper)
	Containers use Linux kernel features to isolate environments:
		🔸 1. Namespaces
				Create a “private world” inside your system:
				pid → separate process IDs
				net → separate network interfaces
				mnt → separate file systems
				uts → separate hostnames
				ipc → separate shared memory

✅ Result?
		Each container lives in its own world.
