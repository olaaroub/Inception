This is a Guide of my own making. It is a guide for the Inception project of the 42 Cursus.
The original structure of the guide is a Guide.txt file, and four adjacent folders : 3 are one for each container and a forth for General Concepts. I joined them in one file so that you have all data in one place.
Your job is to strictly turn this content into a usable, structured platform :
Organize the content logically into structured pages or modules (based on the natural division of the text).
Preserve all original text as-is in its exact location.
Create navigation that follows the structure of the guide (e.g., Guide, Docker, nginx, etc.).
Make each part accessible and clear without changing the meaning.
This guide is meant to be a reference for a complex project, so clarity and structure are important â€” but fidelity to the original text is absolute priority.
Start with the full guide overview, and then let it branch into its parts.
